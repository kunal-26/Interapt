**Fully Coded Elements**

Soft UI Dashboard is built with over 70 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, navtabs, cards or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in colour, that you can easily modify using SASS files and classes.

You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code, because all elements are implemented.
This Free Bootstrap 5 Dashboard is coming with prebuilt design blocks, so the development process is seamless,
switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.


**Documentation built by Developers**

Each element is well presented in a very complex documentation.

**Example Pages**

If you want to get inspiration or just show something directly to your clients,
you can jump start your development with our pre-built example pages. You will be able
to quickly set up the basic structure for your web project.
